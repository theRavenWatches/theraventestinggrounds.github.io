            <p>The Raven is a digital audio based web horror story that is mostly based on speculation by the viewer. Not a lot will make sense yet. It will in time as this site gets updated. Believe me.<br><br>Since it isn't explicitly said anywhere else currently, 'see.file' is the only command that is available right now (or is it i dont really know). refer to the google doc for the commands to open files lol.<br><br>DO NOT INSPECT HTML<br>Because this is all built on github, inspecting the HTML files would give away some secrets you're meant to find on your own<br>Please don't spoil, this story is only interesting if you let it be.</p>
