The audio is about the only thing I could recover from the tape, and listening to it is.. Disturbing. Sent a chill down my spine. I’m assuming this is some inside joke because what kind of company makes a tape like this? Also, the tape had more black spots on it, like the paper. Come to think of it.. My mouse is covered in the stuff too. I’ll talk to corporate about it. Probably just some ink errors but they told me to report everything so I’ll just do my job I guess.<br><br>Off I go.`;

This one is proving a bit tricky to digitize but I’ll upload it here once it is finished.<br><br>Now for some more good news for me personally! I got a dog! Her name is Luna. She’s a good dog, got her from the pound. I don’t know if it is magic, but her being around seems to alleviate my headache. Then I go back to work and my head wants to explode. I’m convinced it’s my job. Might see a doctor if this gets worse. I’ve also been included in more research! I got to see some huge labs with genetics. Can’t legally talk about it here though, even IF it is private. Corporate wants me to keep hush hush. I’ll get back to this with the tape next log, I promise you.';

He was lying in the fetal position and he was holding a shotgun in his left hand. Further investigation shows that the shotgun had been fired multiple times. Brock’s skull was caved in directly on his nose. His arms had been forcefully torn off as shown by tension near the ligaments. The same can be said for his left leg. The entire crime scene was bloody, suggesting a struggle. Struggle is also suggested by scuff marks in the dirt around him. No other prints were found at the scene and the killer has yet to be identified. Witnesses say late at night they heard Brock screaming “Please don’t kill me! I have a family!” followed by a loud screeching noise before silence.  When his body was discovered, his eyes were allegedly missing. When police arrived at the scene, this was proven false.`;

Apparently we’re so adamant on finishing that because it will prove it is possible to do, and the government is gonna fund human research. I don’t buy that belief at all.
