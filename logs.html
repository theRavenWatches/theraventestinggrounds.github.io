I’m talking about vintage papers, real old stuff.<br>Something strange though, one of the papers was covered with black stains and the only words visible on it were ‘Raven’ and ‘God’. Probably just some kid messing with us. Though, I did find this awful smelling vhs tape. It has a piece of tape on it that has ‘Tape 01’ etched in black marker. And it smells like dog shit. Literally. The tape is pretty beat up but surprisingly the audio is in good condition. Truly a miracle.<br>I wonder if there are other tapes, seeing as though it is labeled as ‘01’<br><br><audio controls><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theRavenWatches/theRavenWatches.github.io/main/audio/tape01.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br><br>This is just for documentation sake. The audio is about the only thing I could recover from the tape, and listening to it is.. Disturbing. Sent a chill down my spine. I’m assuming this is some inside joke because what kind of company makes a tape like this? Also, the tape had more black spots on it, like the paper. Come to think of it.. My mouse is covered in the stuff too. I’ll talk to corporate about it. Probably just some ink errors but they told me to report everything so I’ll just do my job I guess.<br><br>Off I go.`;

He hasn’t been heard from since, and I’m starting to worry about myself. I kept working though, I’m a trooper, but my head is beginning to feel even more dizzy. I can fight it off for right now but I’d be damned if it doesn’t get worse.<br><br>Anyway, good news, found another tape. Tape 02. This one is proving a bit tricky to digitize but I’ll upload it here once it is finished.<br><br>Now for some more good news for me personally! I got a dog! Her name is Luna. She’s a good dog, got her from the pound. I don’t know if it is magic, but her being around seems to alleviate my headache. Then I go back to work and my head wants to explode. I’m convinced it’s my job. Might see a doctor if this gets worse. I’ve also been included in more research! I got to see some huge labs with genetics. Can’t legally talk about it here though, even IF it is private. Corporate wants me to keep hush hush. I’ll get back to this with the tape next log, I promise you.';

The tape did some interesting stuff I should probably mention. It kept crashing my pc when digitalizing the audio. I’m convinced it broke it or something because corporate had to rush to bring me the new one. The old one apparently exploded while I was home. Yikes. Sucks for the janitor.. And my coworker..<br><br>This tape was completely normal! Just some old employee instruction tape from way back when. My coworker said he heard the tape glitching out but I didn’t. I guess he’s going crazy. Or maybe I am…<br><br>Anyway, update on Luna, she seems to be well trained already. Less work for me! She’s been looking at my window a lot though, like if she’s anticipating something. Or maybe I’m just paranoid after listening to that first tape.<br><br>Also, $$$$$$$$ I can type dollar signs!
