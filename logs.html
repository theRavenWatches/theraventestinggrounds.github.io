It’s no wonder corporate wants to preserve all this. There’s papers here dating back to 1945. I’m talking about vintage papers, real old stuff.<br>Something strange though, one of the papers was covered with black stains and the only words visible on it were ‘Raven’ and ‘God’. Probably just some kid messing with us. Though, I did find this awful smelling vhs tape. It has a piece of tape on it that has ‘Tape 01’ etched in black marker. And it smells like dog shit. Literally. The tape is pretty beat up but surprisingly the audio is in good condition. Truly a miracle.<br>I wonder if there are other tapes, seeing as though it is labeled as ‘01’<br><br><audio controls><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theRavenWatches/theRavenWatches.github.io/main/audio/tape01.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br><br>This is just for documentation sake. The audio is about the only thing I could recover from the tape, and listening to it is.. Disturbing. Sent a chill down my spine. I’m assuming this is some inside joke because what kind of company makes a tape like this? Also, the tape had more black spots on it, like the paper. Come to think of it.. My mouse is covered in the stuff too. I’ll talk to corporate about it. Probably just some ink errors but they told me to report everything so I’ll just do my job I guess.<br><br>Off I go.`;
